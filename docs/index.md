# Eva Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Eva! This guide will walk you through the most critical first steps to get your account running and optimized. Let's dive in.

### Step 1: Connect Your Accounts

First things first, Eva needs data to work its magic. You'll begin by connecting your Amazon Seller Central and Advertising accounts. Our connection wizard will guide you through the process to grant the necessary permissions.

* **Why it's critical:** Without an active advertising connection, Eva cannot see your ad metrics (like sales, spend, ACOS, etc.) and won't be able to provide insights or perform optimizations for you.

### Step 2: Get to Know the Trend Analytics Dashboard

Once your accounts are connected, you'll land on the **Trend Analytics** page. This is your command center for a high-level view of your business performance.

* **Performance Chart:** This chart visualizes your key metrics over time. Monetary values (e.g., Ad Sales) appear as bars, while ratios (e.g., ROAS) are shown as lines, making trends easy to spot.
* **Filters & Date Range:** Use the filters at the top of the page to focus on a specific group of products or select a custom date range for your analysis.

### Step 3: Set Your First Strategy (Store-Level Goal)

This is the most important step to activate Eva's AI. You will tell the system what your overall advertising strategy is. You can set this from the **Advertising Center > Configurations > Store Settings** page.

1.  **Choose Your Focus:** Use the strategy slider to set your goal anywhere between `Growth Focused` and `Profit Focused`.
2.  **Select Your Target Type:** Choose either **ACOS** or **TACOS** as your primary target. TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales) provides a more holistic view by measuring your ad spend against your *total* revenue.
3.  **Define Bid Limits:** Set minimum and maximum bid values to ensure the AI operates within your budget constraints.
4.  **Save Your Goal:** Click the `Save Goal` button. Congratulations, you've just activated the AI!

### Step 4: Review Your Campaigns

After setting your store-level goal, head over to the **Campaign View** page to see how it applies to your existing campaigns.

* **Goal Info Column:** In the table, you'll see this column displaying the target you just set. This shows that your campaigns have inherited the overall strategy from the store level.
* **Hierarchical View:** You can click to expand any campaign to see its associated Ad Groups, ASINs, and the specific targets within them.
