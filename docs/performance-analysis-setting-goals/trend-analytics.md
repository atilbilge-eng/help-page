# Trend Analytics Help Page

Welcome to the **Trend Analytics** page! This tool provides a detailed, time-based view of your campaign performance, allowing you to track key metrics, adjust your goals, and optimize your advertising strategy.

## Key Metrics

When you access the **Trend Analytics** page, you will see a variety of key metrics displayed, which are critical to understanding your ad campaign performance such as:

1. **ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales)**
2. **TACoS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales)**
3. **Impressions**
4. **Clicks**
5. **Sales**

In addition to these core metrics, the following are available:

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
- **CVR (Conversion Rate)**
- **Orders**
- **Cost**
- **CPC (Cost per Click)**
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- **AOV (Average Order Value)**

These metrics are displayed in tabular format and also used for filtering the data displayed on the charts. You can filter your campaigns, time ranges, and performance metrics to get insights tailored to your needs. To view a full list of all metrics and definitions, refer to the [Trend Analytics Metrics Details](performance-analysis-setting-goals/trend-analytics-metrics-details.md).

## Analyzing Trends

**Trend Analytics** enables you to visualize your data across different timeframes:

- **Daily View**: View your performance by day, ideal for short-term analysis.
- **Weekly View**: See aggregated data by week for broader trend analysis.
- **Monthly View**: For long-term performance monitoring, view data grouped by month.

This flexibility helps you track the performance of your campaigns over time and identify patterns or fluctuations in your advertising results.

## Setting and Tracking Goals

### Store-Level Goals

At the store level, **Trend Analytics** allows you to set overall advertising goals for your store, which could be based on metrics such as **ACoS** or **TACoS**. Once set, you can monitor your progress toward these goals directly on the page, making it easier to adjust strategies as necessary.

- **Monitor progress** against store-level goals.
- **Adjust targets** for specific campaigns based on performance.

For more on how to set and track store-level goals, refer to the [Setting Store-Level Goals](ad-strategies/store-level-goals.md).

### Product-Level Insights

For more granular analysis, **Trend Analytics** also provides insights at the product level. You can track how individual products contribute to your store's overall ad performance. Key actions include:

- **Tracking product performance** for better decision-making.
- **Identifying high-performing products** that need more investment.

## Customizing Your Data View

You can fine-tune the way your data is displayed by using the **advanced filtering options**. Filters allow you to focus on specific campaigns, metrics, or date ranges. Use these to:

- **Filter by metric** (e.g., **ACoS**, **CVR**).
- **Adjust the time range** (e.g., **Last 7 Days**, **Last Month**).
- **Focus on specific targets** or products.

These filters help you dig deeper into performance and identify areas of improvement.

## Adjusting Bid Strategies

With the insights gained from **Trend Analytics**, you can adjust your bid strategies:

- **Increase bids** for high-performing products or ad groups.
- **Decrease bids** for underperforming ones.

By linking **Trend Analytics** with your bid management, you can make data-driven decisions to improve your overall return on ad spend (ROAS).
