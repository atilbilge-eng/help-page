# Grow Your Amazon Business with Eva AI

You know that great products aren't enough on Amazon—you have to advertise them to win. But managing daily ad campaigns and budgets can quickly become a maze of complex data and manual work. What if you could have an intelligent partner that turns that complexity into a clear path to profitability?

That's the power of Eva AI. We're not just another analytics dashboard. We're an advanced advertising engine designed to help you master your campaigns, save valuable time, and dramatically increase your return on ad spend.

### Streamline Your Workflow to Save Time

Your time is valuable. Eva helps you spend less of it on tedious tasks and more on growing your business.

* **From Product Performance to Campaign Action:** Your journey begins with a comprehensive view of your entire catalog on the **Trend Analytics** page. You can seamlessly dive from a high-level product list into a single product's detailed performance and see all the campaigns associated with it. This lets you take immediate, targeted action on the campaigns that are driving sales for that specific item.
* **Master Your Campaigns and Targets:** The **Campaign View** gives you a single screen to manage campaigns, ad groups, ASINs, and targets, all within a clear, hierarchical structure. Similarly, the **Target View** unifies all your targeting types—from keywords to audiences—in one interactive interface. This gives you granular control without the constant context switching.
* **Intuitive Goal Setting:** You can set a broad strategy for your entire store or create specific goals for individual products or campaigns. Eva's AI will then automatically optimize your bids to hit those targets. This gives you granular control without the constant manual adjustments.
* **Smart Automation:** Automate key tasks like pausing ads for out-of-stock products or creating new campaigns based on your own custom rules. This frees you from repetitive tasks and ensures your campaigns are always running at peak efficiency.

### Unlock Data-Driven Decisions for Smarter Spending

Don't just look at your data—act on it. Our platform gives you the insights you need to make confident decisions that drive real growth.

* **Proactive Insights:** The **Amazon PPC Audit Report** and the **AI Decisions** page proactively flag areas that need your attention. We help you find wasted ad spend, critical performance errors, and missed targeting opportunities so you can quickly fix what's broken and capitalize on what's working.
* **Context-Aware Metrics:** Our dashboards integrate critical metrics from your store, like inventory levels and profitability, with your advertising data. This context-aware approach ensures you're never running ads for a product you can't fulfill or for a campaign that isn't profitable overall.

With Eva, you gain a competitive edge by making smarter, data-driven advertising decisions that grow your market share and your bottom line.
